<h2><a id="by-esther" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>By Esther</h2>
<p>I have long heard that children are much more keen than grown-ups in the presence of beauty. When I was still in my girlhood, I secretly observed the adults around me and discreetly concluded that this “rule” generally applied to all. Grown-ups tended to turn a blind eye to all the things that mattered, all the things that seemed beautiful to the 7-year-old me. They hardly ever find rain-soaked meadows beautiful, or snails crawling up a wall peaceful, or wandering aimlessly enormously ravishing. Those trivial happiness, according to their lights, are invariably “messy” “time-wasting” and “meaningless”. As a child who was bestowed the gift of beauty-finding, I could not hide my pity and sympathy for those mature yet barren minds. As a result, I was much afraid of growing up. I feared one day I would just be like them, indifferent to the abundant beauty, insulated to the universal happiness, pathetically bustling through life.</p>
<p>And now I have reached 18, a confusing and arduous period of life. During the years, just like my wardrobe was constantly updating, my perception of beauty has also undergone great changes. As I have traveled much further on the road of academic pursuit, my evolving intelligence determines the things that I now find beautiful are: a well-structured essay, a neat note written in decent hand-writing, punctual class breaks—ordered, but also comparatively rigid, tedious and dreary. They are beautiful simply because compared to other existence in my life, they are relatively pleasing. In other words, my enjoyment of beauty has suffered a dramatic decline in criterion. Meanwhile, I am aware of the shrinkage of my perceptive range. The beautiful things that once were empathized with are now blocked from my heart, like a pebble falling off a dry well, no echos are stirred. For years, I strived to exclude myself from the rule, but that pathetic fate still inevitably befell me. I have become another exhausted, indifferent and oblivious adult.</p>
<p>Is it because child-like innocence has faded away? Is it because life has treated us badly that we only see sufferings? Or is it because while we are occupied developing other skills, we leave behind the most crucial one? I cannot tell. So I keep my observant eyes wide open. And I am persuaded that instead of purely pursuing beauty, we grow up to pursue the incidental value of beautiful things, like when I endeavored to write a well-structured essay—it is not merely order, but good grade that I was expecting. And that subtle difference in motives tells beauty apart. The universal beauty is the purest kind which can be perceived by all. It stirs nothing more than sheer happiness, as we find in both nature and human activities like weddings or births. However, this universal beauty is too often eclipsed by another kind. With a delusive exterior, it is much more desirable, but also dangerously powerful to lead people astray. History has warned us of its underlying danger: the grasp of leadership, the crave for fame, the accumulation of wealth—they are just the path toward this vicious beauty, whether it takes the form of a piece of fertile land, world recognized honor, or a trouble-less life. The alliance of beauty and desire is a road easy to step on, tempting to carry on, and likely to die on. This beauty is like devil’s talk, all along it whispers, poisoning hearts and corrupting minds. In the end, it breeds madness, chaos, treachery and most of all, oblivion. The oblivion of the beauty in bird songs or sunsets, in family bonds or goodness of strangers. The oblivion of the comparatively trivial, plain but real, universal beauty.</p>
<p>So yesterday night, after a torrential rain, I wandered the moist meadow barefoot, enjoying the cool soil pressing against my feet and the vivid grass tickling me. In the sombre light, there was a snail, crawling up a stone wall. I stopped, and saluted him all the way up to the top. Perhaps he understood beauty better than I did.</p>

<p><strong>Comment</strong><br />
A piece of comment From Google<br />
To make a long story short, I tingled with excitement and sorrow when reading the lines. I was touched. Thank you.<br />
My comment will be divided into three parts, namely, content, structure, and language as requested. Hope you’d like it!<br />
This text is briefly rich in content, lots of incisive thoughts mentioned, a pervasive comparison between children’s view to beauty and grown-ups’. Last time I had the similar experience was the time when I went through The Little Prince. You raise the very question at the beginning that grown-ups seem to be deaf to music, and then you tell us your growth, your thought, your discovery, and your confession. In this limited 700 words, you made it!<br />
I really appreciate your writing structure. (You see, you are chasing beauty by bettering your structure, isn’t it?) There are 4 paragraphs in total, and each plays an indispensable role. The first para serves to raise the question, then the second relates your personal experience, the following para is the thought part with which I have a particular fondness, and the last put a satisfactory period to the whole: your text is essentially framed. Yet I have a suggestion for you. The coherence in small parts is very good, for example, “turn a blind eye to all the things that mattered, all the things that seemed beautiful”; but in a more general view it is not equally competent. If you could have brought some effective transitions between paras, I’m sure it would have been much better. For instance, the joint of para3 and para4 is a plain “so”, when I read it, I was like coming from nowhere and heading nowhere as well.<br />
Your language is very succinct, full of precise word choices and fresh phrases. Truth being told, I don’t have advice for this part. So, great!<br />
Hope it could be of help to you! Thank you again for inspiring me with such a beautiful essay! Above.</p>

<p>When the joyful tidings of admission of Beijing Foreign Study’s University evenly silenced and the farewell to my high school gradually coming, a sort of unspoken grief prevailed me, it was such a strong sadness that it even surmounted the joy when knowing the admission. That night I was, with my best friend who had been acknowledged by the University of Toronto, watching a film called The Secret Life of Walter Mitty at a corner of the classroom, in case of disturbing others who were busy preparing entrance examinations. We had had nights like that in passing weeks, but that night protruded out because I knew that it would be the very last night. The dreadful still and deadly silence amid the classroom almost blanked-out me.</p>
<p>The hero in the movie made a resolution to travel far for missing roll films; that tingled with me and on the spur of the moment I also cast the die to take maybe the final walk alone in this familiar school. I shared my guts to him and he screwed his face into an expression of mockery, stung at me skeptically, spitted some trash talks:</p>
<p>“What the hell are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“Well, just…this might be the last night…”, I investigated the surroundings to ascertain nobody had heard my boyish demand, “I think I should have a walk.”</p>
<p>“Boring, since when did you become such an emotional type?” He complained.</p>
<p>I popped out of the classroom swiftly like a rabbit and slid into the dark passage. In avoiding the teachers at stairs surveying the night, I planned another route that would direct me to the first site of my journey—the school laboratory.</p>
<p>In retrospect, two of my classmates and I conduct a scientific study here for the competition in Science and Technology Festival. Our aim is to manufacture a model rocket of which propelled by Oreo and candies. On the ground lies our model rocket—it has a three decimeters body, topped a conical head and bottomed a cylinder for the fuel storage, wearing in red—a production of two days hard work. Now, we are up to our ears in work. One of my teammates is grinding the M&amp;Ms with a club-shaped pestle and another is mixing potassium chlorate with Ammonium bicarbonate, which provides oxygen and dynamic gases, while I am testing for the optimal formula, concerning the different ratios given to different materials.</p>
<p>So, I incinerate a subject and it survives from the test. The flame is steady, and this formula can generate the energy in maximum while leaving the remnant at a minimum. Everything has settled down and we can launch the rocket. I am just so elated that I throw the testee into the trash bin nearby, without noticing there are still some glimmerings of ember. After ten seconds of joyous success comes a fiendish fire; before the launch of the rocket, dense smoke ascends in advance that I quickly discern conflagration. I stumble to the extinguisher at the diagonal corner, but not until I lift it up that I realize that I don’t even know how to use it. I then stumble back, veered my head, sending out SOS to my teammates who are staring at the blazes aghast. My brain reboots after a 20-second void, I lift a bucket of sand and dump it, and thankfully the flame quenches eventually.</p>
<p>As my forehead against the window trying to see through the dark laboratory, this scene somehow revived. A sense of wonder emerged somewhere in me, a sense that would never appear in past years, and I felt the beauty within this sense of wonder! This is the magic of memory: with the passage of time, memories will crystalize into beauty, even if the memory was a sort of bad one.</p>
<p>In my childhood, my mom knitted some colorful clothes for me, and I, without a doubt, considered them ugly and of a shame to wear; but when I grew up and somewhen revisited them, I found them beautiful in some ways. Once I was scolded by my primary school teacher for forgetting the cleaning job: it was the first time for me being scolded in front of classmates, and I really wanted to bury my head underground. However, last summer vacation I visited her, and we talked about it, strangely I saw it a beautiful memory. There has been a long discussion on whether beauty is subjective or objective. Although I would vote for the “objective” party, I really think human beings dominate the sphere. From my view, being beautiful is not the case, in so far as that beauty has been appreciated. A lovely flower, if not being appreciated, is nothing more than a weed; a potential conflagration in the laboratory, which should have been regarded as a terrible accident, can also be a beautiful event when it refrigerates into an individual’s memory.</p>
<p>I escaped from the teaching building safely. In the breeze, I walked across the square, straight to the gym. This was the second time that I skipped classes to the gym to have fun. And the scene of the first time involuntarily committed to my memory…</p>
<p>“Okay, everyone, we’d call it a day, thank you for your participation for today’s rehearsal. Now we’d better come to class for nocturnal self-study.” The director terminates the rehearsal of a drama for the coming English Festival. Directors, actors, rear-service personnel walk out of the gym. I peep out to my two friends, exchanging the message of staying at the gym to play basketball, and within a glimpse, we concur.</p>
<p>The night is falling down, dimming the light in the gym into shimmering spots. When all the staff checks out, we sneak into the storage and steal a basketball, vibrating casually out of the agitation in the pulse as well as the elation in the veins. In the quiet gym where only three students are doing misbehaviors, any sound, no matter how light, will be explosively deafening as if it passes through a mighty megaphone. That means to shun the authority, we play a very gentle basketball: dribbling, shooting, passing, every move is guarded to the lowest sound. In the queer atmosphere, we play it from 6 to 9 o’clock.</p>
<p>And this was my last night, again, I surveyed around to find a basketball. I really wanted to shoot a couple, so as to put a period on my sporting career in high school, but I couldn’t find one. All of a sudden, the arising anguish conquered me. That how blissful that basketball night had been, is exactly how melancholic this night was. I found that this piece of memory, reckoned from what was meant to be a souvenir, painful.</p>
<p>I wobbled my previous conclusion. When a memory crystallized, it could also bring trauma, and something that causes trauma shouldn’t be designated as beauty from my point of view since beauty ought to entertain us in one way or another. I climbed atop the gym contemplating the school. In my teenage, I’ve been sickly familiar with relatives and teachers labeling me docility; in confession, I did behave docilely, remain quiet when grown-ups talking, finish tasks before due, never talk dirty in front of elderships. However, in “real me” a spark of rebelliousness is waiting to be emblazed and fly off. The three-year high school has unfolded my rebelliousness. I broke rules and discipline, I whispered head to head with my desk mate in class, I went steady with a girl who is now the ex. Yet I somehow felt guilty years after because these weren’t cool at all. The gladsome memories ended up with a mixture of beauty and trauma. Put the other way around: memory is in effect not the source of beauty to human beings.</p>
<p>In my new thinking I set out the playground. The moon hid herself behind the thick clouds, a scene so familiar to me that I recollected a wonderful experience with the ex in a night like this.</p>
<p>The ex and I are wandering around the playground hand in hand on the night of the Sports Meeting Festival before the self-study lesson. We stroll in a relaxing manner, chuckling about the morning competition since both of us have earned a gold medal. We are head over heels in love. She is a beauty, when she sings, her sweet, mellifluous, soothing, and fruity voice echoes within my racing heart, knocked me out as if any other sounds to me are discordant and strident; and when she dances, my globe spins flexibly and gracefully, corresponding to her subtle movement. Two cordial hearts now occupy the roomy playground, we talk frivolous and trivial, like two inspectors patrolling the night, and the talk seems to go on and on to the last night of the world.</p>
<p>Until an unexpected yet torrential rain. I believe the Mighty God above is single and he decides to punish these two young kids. We are stunned at the center of the playground, and before we know where we are, the roaring pour has wetted every inch of skin, and only then do we aware of sheltering. I handle her rushing to a rainproof building, in avoidance of being spotted by someone else, we slip beneath the staircase. I stare at the beads downing from her natural hair to peachy cheek. In dark, I kiss her cheek.</p>
<p>I guessed what I would have done if it rained, probably this time I would have let the rainfall drip me wet. I felt my future doomed. Can our bond everlasting, or can I sustain in contact with my friends? At the thought of that, I couldn’t restrain my tears, but I didn’t weep, because the January breeze blew my eyes off and I, therefore, failed to squeeze even a single drop.</p>
<p>I discerned. Every memory that to me seems can be termed “beauty”, seems so because it relates to whom I concern. Provided that I alone at the laboratory had nearly burned it up, or had played basketball in dark by myself, or in the middle of the downpour lonely, I would probably not sing it as beauty. Memory itself is nothing to me, it stirs when I pick up the flourishing events I come through with those I care. And it is these spents-together, bitter or sweet, carved in my memory, to eternity. You may declare that this is shallow, and I would say you are damn right. There are five-star beauties such as powerful theorems or thrilling cosmic images, and my low-grade beauty cannot get on the table. However, it is this sort of beauty, shallow, facile, superficial, that keeps me alive, that warns me the people whom I concern, that makes me human.</p>
<p>I went back classroom at the break. That friend informed me that the hero made it to retrieve the roll films. I answered him with a smile, sat back in my chair, appreciated the scene in the classroom. Girls gossiped with each other on my right, in front of me was a boy teaching mathematics to a girl, a small group gathered practicing English, all these beauties in different shapes and forms melted into the memories of the intense eternity.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>好久没写了🤔。这段时间忙里忙外，还去了一趟武汉开会。事情的起因是佳宁的一句“我们已经五个月了，激情竟然还没褪去”。真是有趣，五个月不是很正常嘛！好吧也不正常，我第二段也就五个月...</p>
<p>今天想随便写点东西，既然昨晚聊天提到了恋爱脑的事儿，那就从这个话题展开吧。这个词儿自从咱在一起后反复被提及，甚至楷文都在在一起第4天左右没有一点点防备地突然来了一句“诶谷歌你不会是个<strong>恋爱脑</strong>吧”。佳宁也经常有“头皮好痒，我长<strong>恋爱脑</strong>啦”云云。我曾经不喜欢这个词，我明明蛮正经的一个人，恋爱（佳宁）对我来说很重要，但绝对不是生活的全部，所以用恋爱脑来形容我多少有点显得我“没有定力”“不理性”“色戒”（？但是随着对她了解加深，磨合得愈发默契，我倒开始愿意称呼自己是一个间歇性恋爱脑的人。</p>
<h2><a id="%E4%BB%80%E4%B9%88%E6%98%AF%E6%81%8B%E7%88%B1%E8%84%91" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>什么是恋爱脑</h2>
<p>恋爱脑 \(\neq\) 精虫上脑只知道恋爱无目的恋爱把恋爱当手段物化爱的人</p>
<p>恋爱脑 \(=\) 懂得爱自己以及爱所爱。</p>
<p>怎么爱自己？在亲密关系中如果感到委屈或者不开心，明白怎么面对这样的情绪并合理调节它。</p>
<p>怎么爱所爱？接纳伴侣的一切，拥有改变自己适应双方舒适节奏的决心，以及宽容。</p>
<h2><a id="%E6%81%8B%E7%88%B1%E8%84%91%E7%9A%84trigger" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>恋爱脑的trigger</h2>
<p>之前看过一句别人说的话：</p>
<blockquote>
<p>爱的本质，就是一种极致的“利他”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>如果把恋爱看作是动态博弈，那么恋爱脑就可以抽象为一种主动出击的合作请求。人都是自私的，科学也证明了人之所以产生爱情的感觉完全是体内化学物质的分泌，但是科学无法证明为什么我只对一个特定的人能产生这种化学物质。同样，恋爱脑不需要trigger，它是一个自然而然的过程。当我感受到我的伴侣爱我时，我就愿意主动提出“合作”。</p>
<p>利他主义体现在我愿意为了你改变我自己，哪怕这会让我感到一点点阵痛，我都不在意。这说到容易做到很难，因此，我慢慢认为一个人如果能进入恋爱脑的状态，那ta简直也太厉害了。</p>
<h2><a id="%E6%88%91%E5%88%B0%E5%BA%95%E6%98%AF%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E2%80%9C%E6%81%8B%E7%88%B1%E8%84%91%E2%80%9D%EF%BC%9F" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>我到底是不是“恋爱脑”？</h2>
<p><strong>是也不是，但我希望我是。</strong><br />
我自诩能够以一个比较冷漠的视角去“审视”恋爱这回事儿。当初多哈会谈时也大放厥词“咱们学习为主”。现在呢，不是每晚贴贴就是白天腻在一起。肢体的亲密接触让我感到愉悦甚至兴奋，排球场上一些只有我们自己懂的小默契让我开心，但是真正让我能够看着佳宁的眼睛，认真说出那三个字的，却是诸如我们真诚的谈心过后、一点点小不开心之后佳宁的道歉之类的。这些事情让我愿意主动出击甚至是一个比较低的姿态去提出合作。也正是这些事情，让我一次又一次的爱上陈同学: )</p>
<p>最后的最后，“恋爱脑”这个词儿也是人发明出来的，甚至是最近才有的，反正2020年之前我完全没听说过这个词。或许这个世界上没有恋爱脑，只有一个人爱一个人。当这个过程是双向的时候，爱情就产生了。</p>

<p>太好笑了，马上回来记录了，写成啥样就啥样吧。</p>
<p>佳宁在中文楼行为实验室上课+工作，我去找她谈天说地（涩涩。没错，自从first kiss之后经历了一些讨论和谈心，我们现在属于是深度涩涩了。当中文楼十点半清楼时，我们“打发”走了保安，在“空无一人”的中文楼隐秘的沙发区<del>哼哼哈兮</del>。因为具体内容属实有点少儿不宜，所以就不展开讲了。但好笑的是，十一点多决定回寝了，才发现所有的门都关闭了😓</p>
<p>说实话我当时脑子完全麻了，佳宁好像一副非常熟练的样子，领着我去一个又一个可能还开着的教室然后跳窗潜逃。但是当一个又一个可能开着的窗户被证明无效时，紧张的情绪逐渐蔓延。能感到她有一点点慌了🤔 反倒是我开始不紧张了，直接摆烂，找个沙发和佳宁躺一晚也不是什么不能接受的事情。</p>
<p>事情的转机发生在我们经过一排教室的时候，佳宁随手开门，结果开到了保安的休息室。结果那个被我们打发走的保安刚好就躺在床上，刚好就还没睡着。经过一番央求他开了门放我们走了。最搞笑的是我还在一旁添油加醋的解释，又是什么实验多忙了一会，又是什么改程序改忘了时间。反正就是佳宁和保安静静看我表演哈哈哈哈。</p>
<p>当然我发现我还是有点不爽的，天杀的保安怎么就睡觉不锁门！要是他没有出现，我和佳宁同学被困在中文楼一晚，会发生什么呢？</p>

<p>这些天里其实并没有发生什么很重大的事情，我们基本就晚上散散步，聊聊天，打打球，不过这些对我来说其实也就够了。寒假在家里90多天的异地让我见到佳宁的第一眼马上就想牵她的手手。不过呢，在这段时间里我做了一件看上去听上去有点搞笑的事情，那就是我酝酿了一次正式的表白。</p>

<p>时间线拨回11月19日，经历了关系的最冰点、三日“多哈”会谈以及专八摧残，我俩几乎就要捅破那层窗户纸了。当然，我的嘴巴是硬的，让我说出表白的话，对当时的我来说实在是一件很羞耻的事情（当然现在也是，可能再过了50天就不会了🤔）。我们坐在操场草坪上对视着，我的心里一直在煎熬，最后我决定鼓起勇气对佳宁说“我喜欢你”，但这几个字反复到嘴边却又反复咽下去。最后我做了一个会让我们永远不会忘记的决定：我去跑圈了.........，我在跑的时候满脑子放空，只有一个想法萦绕着：我要去牵她的手。最后呢，我们也就顺理成章地在一起了。</p>

<p>经历了“内测版”在一起，我在2月17日重新表了一次白。尽管在心里其实已经“do rehearse”了几次了，但是真正面对她的时候，我却再次笨蛋附身，一句话都说不出来。</p>
<ul>
<li>你的一举一动都牵扯着我的心弦</li>
<li>寒假里每一次醒来我的第一反应都是“佳宁肯定早就起来了”</li>
<li>想到你我的心跳停了一拍</li>
<li>我的心里有一座属于你的博物馆</li>
</ul>
<p>我想了包括不限于以上的句子，当然真正考试时一个句型也没派上用场，取而代之的是呜呜呀呀哼哼唧唧。最后当我说出“我们可以在一起吗”时，甚至还有一点紧张。佳宁也是一个非常包容的人，虽然过程很搞笑，甚至这次公测版表白只是一点小小的情趣，最后的结果必然是她点点头。当然最后佳宁打趣我，说幸好只需要经历一次。我想我和她的心路历程完全一致。是的，我希望我之后再也不需要经历它。</p>

<p>其实今天记录并不是因为空了，空是不可能空的。但是呢今天是我们在一起的100天，虽说<del>这只是时间尺度上一个平凡的点....</del> 说nima呢在。今天发生了一件很搞笑的事情，好吧是昨天。</p>
<p>我们例行散步结束后我送佳宁回寝室，经过小碧池，我突然想亲亲她的脸...好吧其实也不突然，我可以一直亲。我拍拍佳宁的肩，把她的脸掰向我想猛嘬几口哈哈哈。结果回头微信说晚安时她说她很自觉地把嘴巴凑了过来，当然我是一点也没有注意到，结果就是我失去了亲佳宁的嘴嘴的好机会！！！！我一定要亲到😈。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>因为所有时间节点都是人主观定义的，所以情人节我向来都是可过可不过的。不过鉴于陈同学圣诞节把我骂了一通，因此这个“重大”日期我还是认真考虑一下吧。</p>
<p>在反复暗示去杭州的想法被反复否决后，制造<strong>惊</strong>喜的想法不太现实😵‍💫；一起用窝窝看个电影，这显然是一个必须项🤔；视频说一些肉麻到死的话...？奇怪这不是每天都在做吗... 综合考虑，最终选择了送花这一个看上去“很平常”但是对我来说是一个重大procedure的表示。</p>
<p>因为从来没送过，不太了解流程，所以还是早在12日就开始准备了。万能知乎给我推荐了一个还算不错的买花平台，我在网络花店里逛了大概半小时。最后选择了分别以蓝色和粉色为主调的候选。蓝色深邃而宁静，是我喜欢的type，但是却有点“剑走偏锋”；粉色温柔而恬雅，却没有创新的冲击感。由于最近的论文在做关于network <strong>robustness</strong>的话题，对鲁棒性的重视是我现在这一阶段的首要追求目标，于是乎选择了粉色。</p>
<p><figure><img src="" alt="聊天记录" /><figcaption>聊天记录<figcaption></figure></p>
<hr />
<p>But when the day bleeds into nightfall... 灰色的事情却悄然发生。</p>
<p>是这样的，当我们再次谈到特殊节日之所以为特殊节日时，圣诞节关于送礼的“糟糕回忆”再次被提及。然后我和佳宁就开始了我所认为的第一次吵架，which was in a sensible way. 我不喜欢她和她girl friend<strong>s</strong>讲这个事情，然后把我放在一个被“审判”的位置；佳宁则说要是不和她们提前说了，她甚至没有办法向我开口。最后这个话题以“时间太晚了”而终结。</p>
<p>可能是我男生直来直去的思维吧，直接和我说这个事情真的没什么困难的...就算没有和好闺蜜们聊，难道佳宁就不会骂我吗？对此我持否定的态度。总之，这个情人节并没有以我想象中的方式开启。</p>
<p>早上起来，佳宁要去拔智齿，中午一回来直接睡去。我忐忑不安，不知道怎么开口提这回事。终于当佳宁在快晚饭的时候将花花的照片发给我时，一颗悬着的心才终于放了下来。佳宁叽叽喳喳地在微信里说着花花多么漂亮以及她怎么挂掉送花员的电话时，半夜里的不愉快全部抛诸脑后。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>喜欢！其实更喜欢的还是你这个浪漫绝缘体努力创造浪漫的可爱样子哈哈哈哈</p>
</blockquote>
<h1><a id="lalaland" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lalaland</h1>
<p>挑选Lalaland作为咱们情人节线上一起看的电影，是一个艰难但又必然的选择。一方面它的故事结尾过于残忍与现实，可另一方面电影的画面、音乐和灯光又美得不像话。就当作for research了😁</p>
<p>当然不出所料，我再一次被这电影🔪了，这个电影在情人节上映的唯一意义就是提醒各位情侣，2.14属于爱情，剩下的364天都属于梦想吧哈哈哈哈哈。不过呢，就像我们约定的，努力成为更好的自己就好。情人节归根到底不过只是时间这一永恒尺度上的随机一点罢了，祝我的小情人每一天都能快乐，不只情人节。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>自从进入2023年，在每次的夜聊中我都感觉佳宁比之前变漂亮了不少🤔。（hhhhh某人看到这儿应该要杀了我）这一观察结果我妈是认同的。昨晚她来问我一个问题碰巧和佳宁聊了几句，结果今天中饭桌上她突然说“诶我咋觉得陈佳宁昨天蛮漂亮的”。Me belike打个哈哈过去，当然心里对她说了句 &quot; C'est normal, non ? &quot;</p>
<p>其实我一直是一个不怎么喜欢拍照的人，一是觉得麻烦，二是觉得最美的画面我往往是由眼睛观察，而不是用镜头捕捉的。但是我也必须承认当下我们分隔在两座城市，照片也不失为是记录并传递生活的好载体。</p>
<p>22岁的生日闷在家里了一天。不能说这个生日很无聊，但是总感觉缺了点什么。做了一碗失败的蛋炒饭，做了一桌还算过的去的晚餐；刷刷视频，看了看书，一天也就这么过去了。佳宁和她的同学们去西湖逛了逛，还看了场电影。在温州没有朋友，没有一些可以常去的公园或景点，生活有点无聊且枯燥。唯一一点慰藉便是睡前和佳宁聊聊天的这一小点空档。她分享了好多她晚上拍的照片。首先是一张模糊、梦幻、意境氛围感爆棚的照片。</p>
<br>
<img src="http://m.qpic.cn/psc?/V530fvDg2pmD5E0Yh9cE0yuUh841aWjY/ruAMsa53pVQWN7FLK88i5jxsBD*OhvGNct.4b79Vp9fZoKYJ0kn0Shmg.tB4dY61GBbrViVmzK6jSZJTd6vKaf4R9igoZcOu6l9S3yPEXfc!/b&bo=OARUBjgEVAYBFzA!&rf=viewer_4" width = "300" alt="氛围感" align=center />
<p>当我看到这张佳宁时，我第一反应是“我靠”。第二反应是她特别像陈绮贞的专辑《华丽的冒险》的封面。而巧合的是，我的生日puq刚好是分享《华丽的冒险》中的歌曲《self》。所以当时那个瞬间我得到了极大的精神满足hhhh。我喜欢这张照片传递出来的粉紫色与烟火氤氲缠绕的感觉。而且画面的模糊恰到好处，让佳宁的眼睛带着一点点烟熏妆，但又很自然的美感。</p>
<br>

<p>这是我第二喜欢的！感觉这一张的佳宁是我最熟悉的佳宁（好怪🤔）。一种活泼灵动的美。我觉得好的摄影作品应该是给人以一种流动感的，显然这张照片就做到了。而且我喜欢昏黄的光打在佳宁脸上的感觉。</p>
<hr />
<p>怎么说呢，我也不太清楚我在写些什么东西😂。不过都在一起50多天了，当看到佳宁时，我还是会忍不住从心底骂出一句“我靠”。我真心相信并希望在未来的500天，5000天，你都是我的无与伦比的美丽。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[
<p>今天晚上聊天佳宁不是很开心，整个人感觉病恹恹的。每到这个时候我会特别无所适从，不知道怎么样让她放松下来。还是朋友阶段的话，或许开几句不着边际的玩笑话就可以应付过去，现在关系不一样了，自然要更加关心她才对。</p>
<p>我自诩我算是一个有道德标准的人，生活中会用普世抑或个人的行为准则约束自己，希望自己不要成为自己口中的渣男。四年前的我“精神出轨”了好朋友，我感到愧疚，这没有什么好去躲避的，我承认它。年龄或许可以成为借口，但它不能成为这件事情的归因，因此我想向佳宁承诺我不会再让这样的事情发生。在一起包括官宣的那两天，很多人来向我祝贺，我对他们都回了一句“接受监督”。恋爱让我得到了很多东西：交流时精神的愉悦、牵手时心跳的悸动、拥抱时接触的满足。亲密关系也让我失去了一些“自由”。然而我愿意承担失去的自由，因为这个世界上只有被约束的文明者。我对你说过恋爱其实是给予对方伤害自己的权利，我现在更觉得，恋爱是履行自己不伤害对方的义务。看吧，其实我还在学习如何在一段亲密关系中对待对方。</p>
<p>佳宁是一个很优秀的女孩，比我更勇敢也比我更聪明。11.19号她质问我还有没有鼓起勇气开启人生新篇章；今晚，管它是上头了还是夜来非，我同样有勇气写下上述的承诺与决心。因为她值得。</p>

<p>和佳宁正式达成全面的学习合作伙伴关系之前，我俩基本处于啥都聊啥都说的状态。有学习有排球有电影有吐槽，偶尔也会聊聊自己对感情对人际关系抑或是死亡啊这一类比较严肃的话题。因为可以信得过的朋友，所以聊起来也是直抒胸臆，压根没有一点false amiability的成分在里面。这样的结果就是，等到我们在一起了，回过头去看的时候，一些话就会很尴尬。</p>
<p>好吧，从我的角度有点尴尬，因为佳宁总是会考一些我之前“好为人师”或者“为情所困”之类的古，她倒好像乐在其中，丝毫没有尴尬的感觉，反而开始当起来陈老师。</p>
<br>

<p>好吧，What can I say? 所以我挑了几个经典好古来看看我当时是怀着一个啥样的心态发给佳宁的，以及我现在是如何感受它们的。</p>

<p>前情提要：那天是我学期第一次排球打二传。（因为一些运动能力的下滑，扣球已经不太行了，接一又接累了，于是替佳宁打二传）</p>

<p>我当然知道那天二传传得不太好，毕竟是三个月来第一次打，手生得不行。我本意是想佳宁稍微鼓励鼓励我，就像每次她让我评价她的扣球，我虽然会说一些小问题，但是总体都是“哇我真的震撼了”云云。于是我让她评价评价我。在我的设想中，这种典型社交场合嘛，肯定就是夸惩结合，双方都心满意足。所以当佳宁说“我会骂你的”时候，我还是心突然一沉😂。不过话都放在那里了，总不能不让人批评吧，我就抱着虚心求教的态度听听她有什么重要指示。上来一句“看似大差不差，实则不够细腻”已经先给我定了性。不过佳宁说的是对的，我传主攻位的时候大部分球都太快了，高的球又没有球头，不能很好的引导主攻手上步发力。副攻位置的传球选择也有很大的问题，沉迷于快攻压根没有想过新生同学可能啥是快攻都还不清楚。最后还有我“引以为傲”的接应，我觉得这下怎么都要夸一夸了吧，结果佳宁还是吝啬了她的溢美之词。最后的最后，她甚至不愿意评价我给的后排进攻😭。我想，那好吧，那就当作学习吧。就这样，离谱的佳宁扼杀了一场潜在的互吹🌈屁，成就了一次翔实的大师课。可恶！</p>
<p>但是不得不说佳宁的辣评最后都是对的，后来我又打了好多次二传，除了副攻位的手活真的不行，主攻和接应都进步了好多。甚至在我学期结束回家前的最后一次当二传的局上，我和佳宁首次尝试的“谷二传宁接应”局中，发挥出了1+1=1亿的效果。这一次佳宁再也没有吝啬她的赞美，而我得到她的赞美时的感受也是真实而快乐的。</p>

<blockquote>
<p>前情提要：佳宁本科大三下有那个一个月多多少少有点离谱，这是她找我当朋友诉说自己烦恼的一个凌晨。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>她来找我说她最近感情方面碰到的小烦恼，说打算和某一位同学撇清关系。虽然作为全程吃瓜者我好好吃瓜就好，但是现在看到这一段记录，竟然感觉有一点小爽🤔？当然重点不在这里，重点在于，这应该是我和佳宁密友阶段第一次认真探讨感情这个话题。当时很严肃的讨论的内容现在看来有点幼稚。后来我和佳宁老提到恋爱中的“减分制”原则就是从这里开始的。但是其实，亲密关系中为什么要减分制呢？用分数来衡量一段感情，来度量一个人在心中的分量本身就是很愚蠢的一件事情。我还发现我真的老在提我的前两段“失败”的恋情，所以佳宁八月十号吐槽得很对。最重要的一点是，佳宁和我谈的很多自己内心的想法让我感到我是被她充分信任的。果然一切的心动瞬间都是早就有铺垫的（</p>
<p>当然这个古的持续时间蛮长的。暑假我去武汉玩，在回来的机场里我和她聊着聊着突然开始批斗我。佳宁毫无征兆地问我她是不是我情感宣泄的慰藉品。我被吓了一跳，一方面我没有这样的想法，我担心如果不把这件事情处理好会带来友谊危机；另一方面更重要的是，我突然想到我有没有可能真的是这样的一个心态，只是我自己之前不知道或者不懂装懂。当然，后来并没有发生什么，我下飞机后也是她来找的我，当作啥也没发生继续聊天。学期中也发生过一些类似的事情，直到学期末在一起了，再回过头来考古发生过的这些对话，我才发现：佳宁一直是更清醒的那个😮‍💨。</p>
