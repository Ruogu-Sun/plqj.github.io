      <h2><a id="by-esther" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>By Esther</h2>
<p>I have long heard that children are much more keen than grown-ups in the presence of beauty. When I was still in my girlhood, I secretly observed the adults around me and discreetly concluded that this “rule” generally applied to all. Grown-ups tended to turn a blind eye to all the things that mattered, all the things that seemed beautiful to the 7-year-old me. They hardly ever find rain-soaked meadows beautiful, or snails crawling up a wall peaceful, or wandering aimlessly enormously ravishing. Those trivial happiness, according to their lights, are invariably “messy” “time-wasting” and “meaningless”. As a child who was bestowed the gift of beauty-finding, I could not hide my pity and sympathy for those mature yet barren minds. As a result, I was much afraid of growing up. I feared one day I would just be like them, indifferent to the abundant beauty, insulated to the universal happiness, pathetically bustling through life.</p>
<p>And now I have reached 18, a confusing and arduous period of life. During the years, just like my wardrobe was constantly updating, my perception of beauty has also undergone great changes. As I have traveled much further on the road of academic pursuit, my evolving intelligence determines the things that I now find beautiful are: a well-structured essay, a neat note written in decent hand-writing, punctual class breaks—ordered, but also comparatively rigid, tedious and dreary. They are beautiful simply because compared to other existence in my life, they are relatively pleasing. In other words, my enjoyment of beauty has suffered a dramatic decline in criterion. Meanwhile, I am aware of the shrinkage of my perceptive range. The beautiful things that once were empathized with are now blocked from my heart, like a pebble falling off a dry well, no echos are stirred. For years, I strived to exclude myself from the rule, but that pathetic fate still inevitably befell me. I have become another exhausted, indifferent and oblivious adult.</p>
<p>Is it because child-like innocence has faded away? Is it because life has treated us badly that we only see sufferings? Or is it because while we are occupied developing other skills, we leave behind the most crucial one? I cannot tell. So I keep my observant eyes wide open. And I am persuaded that instead of purely pursuing beauty, we grow up to pursue the incidental value of beautiful things, like when I endeavored to write a well-structured essay—it is not merely order, but good grade that I was expecting. And that subtle difference in motives tells beauty apart. The universal beauty is the purest kind which can be perceived by all. It stirs nothing more than sheer happiness, as we find in both nature and human activities like weddings or births. However, this universal beauty is too often eclipsed by another kind. With a delusive exterior, it is much more desirable, but also dangerously powerful to lead people astray. History has warned us of its underlying danger: the grasp of leadership, the crave for fame, the accumulation of wealth—they are just the path toward this vicious beauty, whether it takes the form of a piece of fertile land, world recognized honor, or a trouble-less life. The alliance of beauty and desire is a road easy to step on, tempting to carry on, and likely to die on. This beauty is like devil’s talk, all along it whispers, poisoning hearts and corrupting minds. In the end, it breeds madness, chaos, treachery and most of all, oblivion. The oblivion of the beauty in bird songs or sunsets, in family bonds or goodness of strangers. The oblivion of the comparatively trivial, plain but real, universal beauty.</p>
<p>So yesterday night, after a torrential rain, I wandered the moist meadow barefoot, enjoying the cool soil pressing against my feet and the vivid grass tickling me. In the sombre light, there was a snail, crawling up a stone wall. I stopped, and saluted him all the way up to the top. Perhaps he understood beauty better than I did.</p>

<p><strong>Comment</strong><br />
A piece of comment From Google<br />
To make a long story short, I tingled with excitement and sorrow when reading the lines. I was touched. Thank you.<br />
My comment will be divided into three parts, namely, content, structure, and language as requested. Hope you’d like it!<br />
This text is briefly rich in content, lots of incisive thoughts mentioned, a pervasive comparison between children’s view to beauty and grown-ups’. Last time I had the similar experience was the time when I went through The Little Prince. You raise the very question at the beginning that grown-ups seem to be deaf to music, and then you tell us your growth, your thought, your discovery, and your confession. In this limited 700 words, you made it!<br />
I really appreciate your writing structure. (You see, you are chasing beauty by bettering your structure, isn’t it?) There are 4 paragraphs in total, and each plays an indispensable role. The first para serves to raise the question, then the second relates your personal experience, the following para is the thought part with which I have a particular fondness, and the last put a satisfactory period to the whole: your text is essentially framed. Yet I have a suggestion for you. The coherence in small parts is very good, for example, “turn a blind eye to all the things that mattered, all the things that seemed beautiful”; but in a more general view it is not equally competent. If you could have brought some effective transitions between paras, I’m sure it would have been much better. For instance, the joint of para3 and para4 is a plain “so”, when I read it, I was like coming from nowhere and heading nowhere as well.<br />
Your language is very succinct, full of precise word choices and fresh phrases. Truth being told, I don’t have advice for this part. So, great!<br />
Hope it could be of help to you! Thank you again for inspiring me with such a beautiful essay! Above.</p>

<h2><a id="by-google" class="anchor" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>By Google</h2>
<p>When the joyful tidings of admission of Beijing Foreign Study’s University evenly silenced and the farewell to my high school gradually coming, a sort of unspoken grief prevailed me, it was such a strong sadness that it even surmounted the joy when knowing the admission. That night I was, with my best friend who had been acknowledged by the University of Toronto, watching a film called The Secret Life of Walter Mitty at a corner of the classroom, in case of disturbing others who were busy preparing entrance examinations. We had had nights like that in passing weeks, but that night protruded out because I knew that it would be the very last night. The dreadful still and deadly silence amid the classroom almost blanked-out me.</p>
<p>The hero in the movie made a resolution to travel far for missing roll films; that tingled with me and on the spur of the moment I also cast the die to take maybe the final walk alone in this familiar school. I shared my guts to him and he screwed his face into an expression of mockery, stung at me skeptically, spitted some trash talks:</p>
<p>“What the hell are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“Well, just…this might be the last night…”, I investigated the surroundings to ascertain nobody had heard my boyish demand, “I think I should have a walk.”</p>
<p>“Boring, since when did you become such an emotional type?” He complained.</p>
<p>I popped out of the classroom swiftly like a rabbit and slid into the dark passage. In avoiding the teachers at stairs surveying the night, I planned another route that would direct me to the first site of my journey—the school laboratory.</p>
<p>In retrospect, two of my classmates and I conduct a scientific study here for the competition in Science and Technology Festival. Our aim is to manufacture a model rocket of which propelled by Oreo and candies. On the ground lies our model rocket—it has a three decimeters body, topped a conical head and bottomed a cylinder for the fuel storage, wearing in red—a production of two days hard work. Now, we are up to our ears in work. One of my teammates is grinding the M&amp;Ms with a club-shaped pestle and another is mixing potassium chlorate with Ammonium bicarbonate, which provides oxygen and dynamic gases, while I am testing for the optimal formula, concerning the different ratios given to different materials.</p>
<p>So, I incinerate a subject and it survives from the test. The flame is steady, and this formula can generate the energy in maximum while leaving the remnant at a minimum. Everything has settled down and we can launch the rocket. I am just so elated that I throw the testee into the trash bin nearby, without noticing there are still some glimmerings of ember. After ten seconds of joyous success comes a fiendish fire; before the launch of the rocket, dense smoke ascends in advance that I quickly discern conflagration. I stumble to the extinguisher at the diagonal corner, but not until I lift it up that I realize that I don’t even know how to use it. I then stumble back, veered my head, sending out SOS to my teammates who are staring at the blazes aghast. My brain reboots after a 20-second void, I lift a bucket of sand and dump it, and thankfully the flame quenches eventually.</p>
<p>As my forehead against the window trying to see through the dark laboratory, this scene somehow revived. A sense of wonder emerged somewhere in me, a sense that would never appear in past years, and I felt the beauty within this sense of wonder! This is the magic of memory: with the passage of time, memories will crystalize into beauty, even if the memory was a sort of bad one.</p>
<p>In my childhood, my mom knitted some colorful clothes for me, and I, without a doubt, considered them ugly and of a shame to wear; but when I grew up and somewhen revisited them, I found them beautiful in some ways. Once I was scolded by my primary school teacher for forgetting the cleaning job: it was the first time for me being scolded in front of classmates, and I really wanted to bury my head underground. However, last summer vacation I visited her, and we talked about it, strangely I saw it a beautiful memory. There has been a long discussion on whether beauty is subjective or objective. Although I would vote for the “objective” party, I really think human beings dominate the sphere. From my view, being beautiful is not the case, in so far as that beauty has been appreciated. A lovely flower, if not being appreciated, is nothing more than a weed; a potential conflagration in the laboratory, which should have been regarded as a terrible accident, can also be a beautiful event when it refrigerates into an individual’s memory.</p>
<p>I escaped from the teaching building safely. In the breeze, I walked across the square, straight to the gym. This was the second time that I skipped classes to the gym to have fun. And the scene of the first time involuntarily committed to my memory…</p>
<p>“Okay, everyone, we’d call it a day, thank you for your participation for today’s rehearsal. Now we’d better come to class for nocturnal self-study.” The director terminates the rehearsal of a drama for the coming English Festival. Directors, actors, rear-service personnel walk out of the gym. I peep out to my two friends, exchanging the message of staying at the gym to play basketball, and within a glimpse, we concur.</p>
<p>The night is falling down, dimming the light in the gym into shimmering spots. When all the staff checks out, we sneak into the storage and steal a basketball, vibrating casually out of the agitation in the pulse as well as the elation in the veins. In the quiet gym where only three students are doing misbehaviors, any sound, no matter how light, will be explosively deafening as if it passes through a mighty megaphone. That means to shun the authority, we play a very gentle basketball: dribbling, shooting, passing, every move is guarded to the lowest sound. In the queer atmosphere, we play it from 6 to 9 o’clock.</p>
<p>And this was my last night, again, I surveyed around to find a basketball. I really wanted to shoot a couple, so as to put a period on my sporting career in high school, but I couldn’t find one. All of a sudden, the arising anguish conquered me. That how blissful that basketball night had been, is exactly how melancholic this night was. I found that this piece of memory, reckoned from what was meant to be a souvenir, painful.</p>
<p>I wobbled my previous conclusion. When a memory crystallized, it could also bring trauma, and something that causes trauma shouldn’t be designated as beauty from my point of view since beauty ought to entertain us in one way or another. I climbed atop the gym contemplating the school. In my teenage, I’ve been sickly familiar with relatives and teachers labeling me docility; in confession, I did behave docilely, remain quiet when grown-ups talking, finish tasks before due, never talk dirty in front of elderships. However, in “real me” a spark of rebelliousness is waiting to be emblazed and fly off. The three-year high school has unfolded my rebelliousness. I broke rules and discipline, I whispered head to head with my desk mate in class, I went steady with a girl who is now the ex. Yet I somehow felt guilty years after because these weren’t cool at all. The gladsome memories ended up with a mixture of beauty and trauma. Put the other way around: memory is in effect not the source of beauty to human beings.</p>
<p>In my new thinking I set out the playground. The moon hid herself behind the thick clouds, a scene so familiar to me that I recollected a wonderful experience with the ex in a night like this.</p>
<p>The ex and I are wandering around the playground hand in hand on the night of the Sports Meeting Festival before the self-study lesson. We stroll in a relaxing manner, chuckling about the morning competition since both of us have earned a gold medal. We are head over heels in love. She is a beauty, when she sings, her sweet, mellifluous, soothing, and fruity voice echoes within my racing heart, knocked me out as if any other sounds to me are discordant and strident; and when she dances, my globe spins flexibly and gracefully, corresponding to her subtle movement. Two cordial hearts now occupy the roomy playground, we talk frivolous and trivial, like two inspectors patrolling the night, and the talk seems to go on and on to the last night of the world.</p>
<p>Until an unexpected yet torrential rain. I believe the Mighty God above is single and he decides to punish these two young kids. We are stunned at the center of the playground, and before we know where we are, the roaring pour has wetted every inch of skin, and only then do we aware of sheltering. I handle her rushing to a rainproof building, in avoidance of being spotted by someone else, we slip beneath the staircase. I stare at the beads downing from her natural hair to peachy cheek. In dark, I kiss her cheek.</p>
<p>I guessed what I would have done if it rained, probably this time I would have let the rainfall drip me wet. I felt my future doomed. Can our bond everlasting, or can I sustain in contact with my friends? At the thought of that, I couldn’t restrain my tears, but I didn’t weep, because the January breeze blew my eyes off and I, therefore, failed to squeeze even a single drop.</p>
<p>I discerned. Every memory that to me seems can be termed “beauty”, seems so because it relates to whom I concern. Provided that I alone at the laboratory had nearly burned it up, or had played basketball in dark by myself, or in the middle of the downpour lonely, I would probably not sing it as beauty. Memory itself is nothing to me, it stirs when I pick up the flourishing events I come through with those I care. And it is these spents-together, bitter or sweet, carved in my memory, to eternity. You may declare that this is shallow, and I would say you are damn right. There are five-star beauties such as powerful theorems or thrilling cosmic images, and my low-grade beauty cannot get on the table. However, it is this sort of beauty, shallow, facile, superficial, that keeps me alive, that warns me the people whom I concern, that makes me human.</p>
<p>I went back classroom at the break. That friend informed me that the hero made it to retrieve the roll films. I answered him with a smile, sat back in my chair, appreciated the scene in the classroom. Girls gossiped with each other on my right, in front of me was a boy teaching mathematics to a girl, a small group gathered practicing English, all these beauties in different shapes and forms melted into the memories of the intense eternity.</p>
